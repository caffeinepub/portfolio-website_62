# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page personal portfolio website with a modern dark-mode design, backed by a Motoko backend for persisted portfolio data.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a sticky top navigation bar with smooth scroll links to all sections
- Build a Hero section with name placeholder, tagline, CTA button, and abstract background image
- Build an About Me section with bio text block and avatar placeholder image
- Build a Skills section displaying skill categories with badges or progress bar indicators
- Build a Projects section with a grid of project cards (title, description, link placeholders)
- Build a Contact section with name, email, message fields and a submit button
- Apply a cohesive dark-mode theme with amber/gold accents, sans-serif typography, hover/scroll animations, and full responsiveness
- Implement a Motoko backend actor exposing query functions for bio, skills, and projects, and update functions to modify them, with stable storage

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view a polished, responsive portfolio site with all sections navigable via the sticky nav, content loaded from the backend, and custom hero background and avatar images displayed.
